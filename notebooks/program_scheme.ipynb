    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "I was trying to implement **XCAL**. But, how do we define plus and minus phases without spaghetti code? We want to easily modify program behavior, but hard-coding what a \"trial\" is into the network object makes it very difficult for end-users to change the definition of a \"trial\" later.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Humans** like to think about the following things:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Trials\n",
    "* Epochs\n",
    "* Clamping\n",
    "* ....\n",
    "\n",
    "And parameters for the above. They particularly *don't* like to think about setup/teardown (who wants to remember to end plus phases before beginning minus phases?)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Networks** don't care about human stuff. They care about commands like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Begin plus phase\n",
    "* Cycle! Cycle! Cycle!\n",
    "* End plus phase\n",
    "* Begin minus phase\n",
    "* ...\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mixing** the two domains is *bad* because it forces humans and networks to know/care about stuff they dont' care about.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution? Treat the network like a computer processor. Take high-level programs that the user writes, compile them down into \"network code\", and let the network run the \"network code.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of this approach\n",
    "\n",
    "* Separation of concerns\n",
    "* Users can specify network behavior in a *declarative* way (good for reproducibility) without knowing about the internals of how the network, runs. This, I think, was a difficulty with Emergent.\n",
    "* Well-researched foundations in compiler theory\n",
    "* Enables parallelism in future due to async network event handling\n",
    "* Potential for domain specific language if it becomes absolutely necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation tour\n",
    "\n",
    "A **program** is just a **directed, rooted tree.** (see program above.)\n",
    "\n",
    "To \"compile\" the program, we simply do a left-right depth-first-search preorder traversal of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "*In case of compiler nerd people: this tree happens to be exactly the same as an abstract syntax tree (AST) :) *"
